# jarvis
A Python-based voice assistant called Jarvis that uses speech recognition and text-to-speech to interact with users. It can tell the time and date, search Wikipedia, check weather, CPU and battery status, tell jokes, send emails, take screenshots, open websites, play music, set reminders, and control basic system functions.
